CREATIVE PORTION:

For our creative portion, we first decided to make a 'scroll to top' function to explore javascript functionality. We created a button that is hidden except when the user is scrolled to the top of the page. Using the window.onscroll option, we created a function where the button is shown when the page is scrolled (aka not at the top).
We also created a sign up feature to add functionality to our website.
Additionally, when creating an event, the user is given the option to label events as either 'school' or 'home' events. When displayed on the calendar, school events are written in blue and home events are written in red. Events without a label are in black. This provides extra information to the user.
Lastly, we added an admin account that has the ability to view all of the events (across all users) in the database. This serves as a visualization of important aspects of the database for the website owner. That is, they can see the information in the database without having to go through terminal.
